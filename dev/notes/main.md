 * “And a new philosophy emerged called quantum physics, which suggest
 *  that the individual’s function is to inform and be informed. You
 *  really exist only when you’re in a field sharing and exchanging
 *  information. You create the realities you inhabit.” 
 *
 *      ― Timothy Leary, Chaos & Cyber Culture

 * Purpose:
 *
 *      This file contains the main definition of cultivus.
 *
 * Used for the semantic system implemented in Stylus. To be a bit more
 * memory efficient I used tuples of common used verbs, and as little
 * aliases as felt needed. This may change heavily.
 * 
 *
 * Several synonyms were intentionally left in this map, use them as the
 * rules become easier or harder to justify in your native tongue by easily
 * mapping them to other forms:
 *
 * to_make     to_create[0] to_create[0] to_create[0]
 * to_create
 *
 * Tip: try adding adjectives after it, such as successful' or 'failed'
 * behind the gerund: e.g. Module loading successful, or, Compiling
 * failed
