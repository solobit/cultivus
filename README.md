Cultivus
========

##### *“Solitude is the soil in which genius is planted, creativity grows, and legends bloom; faith in oneself is the rain that cultivates a hero to endure the storm, and bare the genesis of a new world, a new forest.”*

I had known full well the taste of failure; I was no Navy SEAL, but an underdog soldier: a sand-sailor with a mediocre performance record at best, who knew more about how to jump
from a burning building than he did about any technical part of a ship. This particular
building was a hotel in Bahrain, one of countless around, and I stood on its flat roof
with my harness hooked and smoke in my lungs.

Though, despite the doubt that marred my confidence, I remained an idealist; my life may
not have turned out to be the war-hero's dream that I originally wanted, but I still
believed in some part of humanity worth fighting for—the parts of humanity that rarely
make it to TV. There could have been someone inside; if there was, I wanted to save them.
But the team and I were ordered to stand down; my superiors didn't believe in taking the
risk of trading one of our lives, for a native's.

That day, I disobeyed a direct order, and rebelled by jumping from the rooftop, anyway.
