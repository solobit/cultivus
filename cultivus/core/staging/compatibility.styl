/* Fault tolerance configuration
 * 
 * Progressive enhancement, shims, graceful fallbacks vendor prefixes,
 * backwards compatibility from language to browser since there won't be
 * that many at any given time (since others get solved and browsers
 * evolve at a certain rate). This is something you want working
 * properly and maintain if you wish to provide forms of backwards and
 * cross-browser support of usually 'cutting-edge' effects (those things
 * from new specifications which have not been implemented, or
 * partially, yet).

 * Progressive enhancement, enrichment, decorations, meta-stuff
 *
 * At first I thought about putting this in a IE module, but for the
 * sake of being positive, and probably right in the future still
 * progressive techniques might be needed regardless of specific vendor.
 *
 * So any stuff that goes for 'progressive enhancement' or 'enrichment'
 * what not, belongs here.
